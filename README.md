  - Mac: Right Click folder and select *New Terminal at Folder*
- Run the following command:

```sh
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start
```

Where **my-app** is the name of the new project. You can change it later

## Running the example 

- Download or clone this repository

- Open terminal in the project root folder following the above instructions

- Run the following command:

  ```sh
  npm start
  ```

- Your default browser will open the local server automaticaly
